# 1. What are Actions in React?

In React, an **Action** is not a built-in API but a **concept** most commonly used when talking about **state management** (like Redux, useReducer, or Context).
An action is simply an **object (or event)** that describes _what happened_ in the app, not _how to change the state_.

- **In plain React:** Actions are usually **event handlers** (like `onClick`, `onChange`) that _trigger state updates_.
- **In reducers (Redux, useReducer):** Actions are **objects with a `type` and optional `payload`** that tell the reducer how to update state.

---

## 2. When and Why to Use Actions

- **Simple apps:** Directly update state with `useState` and event handlers.
- **Complex state logic:** Use **actions with reducers** to centralize state updates. This makes the code more predictable and easier to debug.
- **Global state management:** Actions become essential when using **Redux, Zustand, or Context + useReducer**, because they provide a structured way to describe changes across the app.

## 3. Code Examples

### ðŸ”¹ Actions in Basic React (with `useState`)

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Action = button click event handler
  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>+1</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-1</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Here the "action" is simply the **function triggered by an event**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Actions with `useReducer`

```jsx
import { useReducer } from "react";

// Reducer function: how state changes depending on action type
function counterReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "DECREMENT":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, { count: 0 });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      {/* Dispatch actions instead of directly updating state */}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" })}>+1</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "DECREMENT" })}>-1</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- **Action objects** are `{ type: "INCREMENT" }`, `{ type: "DECREMENT" }`.
- Reducer decides how the state changes.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Actions in Redux (same concept, but global)

```js
// action creators
export const increment = () => ({ type: "INCREMENT" });
export const decrement = () => ({ type: "DECREMENT" });

// later in component
dispatch(increment());
dispatch(decrement());
```

Redux enforces actions as **serializable objects**, which helps with debugging and middleware.

## 4. Visual Aid: How Actions Work with Reducers

```pseudo
[User clicks button]
      â†“
   (Action)  ---> { type: "INCREMENT" }
      â†“
   Reducer(state, action) ---> new state
      â†“
  React re-renders component
```

---

âœ… **Summary:**

- In React, **actions = descriptions of "what happened"**.
- With `useState`, actions are usually event handlers.
- With `useReducer`/Redux, actions are **objects** dispatched to a reducer.
- Actions help organize **complex state updates** and make logic predictable.
